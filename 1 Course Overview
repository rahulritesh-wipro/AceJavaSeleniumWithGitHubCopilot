GitHub Copilot for Automation Scripting


Hey everyone, welcome to this exciting course on using GitHub Copilot tool for Selenium Automation Scripts generation. 

If you're someone who's working with Selenium or just getting started with automation testing, this video is going to show you how AI can supercharge your scripting workflow.


In this course, Iâ€™m using Selenium with Java, along with the BDD Cucumber framework, to generate automation scripts.

But hereâ€™s the key takeaway â€” once you understand the approach of using GitHub Copilot, youâ€™re not limited to just Java or Selenium.

You can apply the same Copilot-assisted workflow to any other programming language or any other automation framework â€” whether itâ€™s Python with PyTest, JavaScript with Cypress, or even API testing tools.

So itâ€™s not just about learning a tool â€” itâ€™s about learning a smart way to code faster and better, no matter what tech stack youâ€™re working with.

Section 1 - Foundation of GitHub Copilot
Section 2 - Practical Demonstration on scripts Generation
Section 3 - Best Practices and Limitations

Welcome to the first section of this course â€” Introduction to GitHub Copilot.

Before we dive into automation scripting, itâ€™s important to understand the foundation of "what GitHub Copilot really is."
Letâ€™s break it down.
Then, weâ€™ll understand what Git is
And First, weâ€™ll look at what a Version Control System actually means
And Finally, weâ€™ll explore what GitHub is

Weâ€™ll also explore:

Who owns GitHub Copilot?
What is an LLM â€” a Large Language Model?
Which LLM powers GitHub Copilot?
And most importantly â€” what are the real benefits of using Copilot for automation scripting or coding?

Next, Iâ€™ll walk you through:

ðŸ”‘ How to get a GitHub Copilot subscription from GitHub.com
ðŸ’» How to set up GitHub Copilot in both IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code
Whether you're using IntelliJ for Java or VS Code for other languages, Iâ€™ll show you how to get Copilot up and running in just a few minutes.

By the end of this section, youâ€™ll have a clear understanding of what GitHub Copilot is, how it works, and how to set it up in your development environment â€” so youâ€™re ready to start using it for automation scripting with Selenium and Java.

In Section 2 - We will see the practical demonstration for Utilizing GitHub Copilot for Automation Scripting with Selenium Java and BDD Cucumber.Like complete automation scripting workflow, powered by GitHub Copilot.
âœ… Creating Feature Files from Test Cases
Weâ€™ll start by converting manual test cases into Cucumber feature files using Gherkin syntax. Youâ€™ll see how Copilot can help you write clear, structured scenarios with minimal effort.

âœ… Building Page Locators and Page Actions Classes
Next, weâ€™ll create Page Object Model (POM) classes â€” separating locators and actions for better maintainability. Copilot will assist in generating locators, methods, and reusable actions.

âœ… Writing Step Definitions
Weâ€™ll then map our feature steps to Java methods using Step Definition classes. Copilot will help us implement these methods quickly, suggesting Selenium commands and logic as we type.

âœ… Creating the Test Runner Class
Youâ€™ll learn how to set up a Test Runner class using Cucumber and TestNG or JUnit. Copilot will help generate the boilerplate code and configuration needed to execute your test suite.

âœ… Generating the Suite XML File
Finally, weâ€™ll create a TestNG suite XML file to organize and run our test classes. Copilot will assist in structuring the XML and linking it with your test runner.


Throughout the course, youâ€™ll see how GitHub Copilot acts like your coding assistant, helping you write automation scripts faster, with fewer errors, and more confidence.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced tester, this course will help you automate smarter â€” not harder.
