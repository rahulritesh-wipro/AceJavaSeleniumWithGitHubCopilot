GitHub Copilot for Automation Scripting

Slide - 1 2 3
Hey everyone, welcome to this exciting course on using GitHub Copilot tool for Selenium Automation Scripts generation. 

If you're someone who's working with Selenium or just getting started with automation testing, this video is going to show you, how AI can supercharge your scripting workflow.


🎙️ Polished & Professional:
"Before we dive into the course overview, let me take a moment to introduce myself."

🎯 Confident & Direct:
"But first, a quick introduction — so you know who’s guiding you through this journey."

🎥 Friendly & Conversational:
"Now, before we jump into what this course has to offer, let me quickly tell you a bit about myself."


I’m currently working as a Test Automation Lead, and I bring along over 9 years of hands-on experience in the world of automation engineering.

Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work across some of the most exciting and challenging domains — from Banking and Payments to E-commerce, Salesforce CRM, and even SAP ERP systems.

Each of these industries taught me something new — how to build smarter frameworks, solve real-world testing problems, and deliver automation solutions that actually make a difference.

And now, I’m here to share all of that with you — along with some powerful AI tools like GitHub Copilot that are changing the way we write automation scripts.

So buckle up — we’re about to make automation faster, smarter, and a whole lot more fun!

Alright — now that you know a bit about me and how this course is structured…

👉 Let’s jump right into the course introduction!

In the next few minutes, I’ll walk you through exactly what you’ll be learning, how we’ll be using GitHub Copilot alongside Selenium with Java, and how each section is designed to help you build real-world automation scripts — faster and smarter.

In this course, I’m using Selenium with Java, along with the BDD Cucumber framework, to generate automation scripts.

But here’s the key takeaway — once you understand the approach of using GitHub Copilot, you’re not limited to just Java or Selenium.

You can apply the same Copilot-assisted workflow to any other programming language or any other automation framework — whether it’s Python with PyTest, JavaScript with Cypress, or even API testing tools.

So it’s not just about learning a tool — it’s about learning a smart way to code faster and better, no matter what tech stack you’re working with.

"We’ve divided this course into three well-organized sections, each designed to guide you through the learning process in a clear and structured way."

Section 1: Foundation of GitHub Copilot
In this section, we’ll build a strong foundation by understanding what GitHub Copilot is, how it works, and how to set it up in your development environment. We’ll also explore the concepts of Git, GitHub, version control systems, and the AI technology behind Copilot.

Section 2: Practical Demonstration on Script Generation
Here’s where we get hands-on. You’ll see how to use GitHub Copilot to generate automation scripts step by step — from creating feature files and page object classes to writing step definitions, test runners, and suite XML files. Everything will be demonstrated live using Selenium with Java and the BDD Cucumber framework.

Section 3: Best Practices and Limitations
Finally, we’ll wrap up with some important insights. You’ll learn the best practices for using Copilot effectively, understand its limitations, and how to ensure the code it generates is reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.


Each section is packed with practical knowledge and real-world examples to help you become confident in using GitHub Copilot for automation scripting.

Let’s get started!

Welcome to the first section of this course — Introduction to GitHub Copilot.

Before we dive into automation scripting, it’s important to understand the foundation of "what GitHub Copilot really is."
Let’s break it down.
Then, we’ll understand what Git is
And First, we’ll look at what a Version Control System actually means
And Finally, we’ll explore what GitHub is

We’ll also explore:

Who owns GitHub Copilot?
What is an LLM — a Large Language Model?
Which LLM powers GitHub Copilot?
And most importantly — what are the real benefits of using Copilot for automation scripting or coding?

Next, I’ll walk you through:

🔑 How to get a GitHub Copilot subscription from GitHub.com
💻 How to set up GitHub Copilot in both IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code
Whether you're using IntelliJ for Java or VS Code for other languages, I’ll show you how to get Copilot up and running in just a few minutes.

By the end of this section, you’ll have a clear understanding of what GitHub Copilot is, how it works, and how to set it up in your development environment — so you’re ready to start using it for automation scripting with Selenium and Java.

In Section 2 - We will see the practical demonstration for Utilizing GitHub Copilot for Automation Scripting with Selenium Java and BDD Cucumber.Like complete automation scripting workflow, powered by GitHub Copilot.
✅ Creating Feature Files from Test Cases
We’ll start by converting manual test cases into Cucumber feature files using Gherkin syntax. You’ll see how Copilot can help you write clear, structured scenarios with minimal effort.

✅ Building Page Locators and Page Actions Classes
Next, we’ll create Page Object Model (POM) classes — separating locators and actions for better maintainability. Copilot will assist in generating locators, methods, and reusable actions.

✅ Writing Step Definitions
We’ll then map our feature steps to Java methods using Step Definition classes. Copilot will help us implement these methods quickly, suggesting Selenium commands and logic as we type.

✅ Creating the Test Runner Class
You’ll learn how to set up a Test Runner class using Cucumber and TestNG or JUnit. Copilot will help generate the boilerplate code and configuration needed to execute your test suite.

✅ Generating the Suite XML File
Finally, we’ll create a TestNG suite XML file to organize and run our test classes. Copilot will assist in structuring the XML and linking it with your test runner.


Throughout the course, you’ll see how GitHub Copilot acts like your coding assistant, helping you write automation scripts faster, with fewer errors, and more confidence.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced tester, this course will help you automate smarter — not harder.
